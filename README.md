# Mars-Rover-Erkin-Kurt

To conquer the Mars, first we had to discover it Houston... It was though but we managed it.

This project is written in C# with ASP.Net Console App. It implements basic movement mechanisim for Rover. 

### Description

The project's intent is to extend the functionalities with lower modification to the core as much as possible.  

### Assumption

This [link](https://support.hackerrank.com/hc/en-us/articles/219617888-Using-STDIN-for-inputs-and-STDOUT-for-outputs) from hackarenk is followed for getting test input and printing out the test output.
Quote from the link:

>STDIN
>
>This is the standard stream to provide or read input values to a program. For example, consider a HackerRank sample question to read two integers, say a and b, and return their sum as the output. 
>
>If coding in C#, you must use Console. ReadLine() to read input values from Test Cases into the variables a and b.
>a= Console.Readline();
>
>b = Console.Readline();
>
>If coding in C, you must use the scanf() statement to read the integer value inputs to your program.
>scanf("%d,%d", &num1, &num2)
>
>STDOUT - This is the standard stream to write or print the output from your code. For example, for the above-mentioned coding question, you need to write the output from your program. 
>
>If coding in C#, you must use the Console.WriteLine() statement to print the output value.
>Console.WriteLine(sum);
>
>If coding in C, you must use the printf() statement to write the output value from your program.
>printf("%dln", a+b);

### Detail
The project is created in this repository but after I created the unit test project, I couldn't recognize that the test project was not in the git repo. So I open a fresh repo.
